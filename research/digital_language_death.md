# Topics

- 7000 spoken language -> 2500 endangered
- digital language death
- digital realm, digital divide
- distinct species // distinct languages
- dominant languages & dialects spread widely and lead to the extinction of other tongues
- phenomenon of digital ascent
- language endangerment & language death

# Contribution

1. language vitality assessment
   - speaker population -> online population
   - oral use -> online use
2. Collect data from online sources
3. Four-way classification
   - T: thriving
   - V: vital
   - H: heritage
   - S: still
4. Build classifiers
5. Conclusion: over 8000 languages are digitally still (= no longer capable of digital ascent)

# Background

- 3 signs of imminent death
  - loss of function (other languages takes completely over, e.g. in commerce)
  - loss of prestige (younger generation denies it)
  - loss of competence (semi-speakers, e.g. younger generation with simplified grammar)
- 2 digitally dead status (= not serving the communication needs of a language community)
  - digital heritage status
    - material is available, but language is not used by L1 speakers for digital communication
  - digital still
    - lack even L2 digital presence
  - important move: digital still -> digital heritage
- digital communication
  - 1970s: electronic document creation
  - 1980s: internet & email 
  - 1990s: web & blogging
  - 2000s: wikis & SMS
- factors to consider
  1. community size & generational composition
     - large and sustainable population is not enough
     - need: active digital engagement (= size of digitally enabled population)
     - not available, therefore proxies
     - would be nice: zoom, twitter, fb data (language identification problem is solved!)
     - instead: publicly available textual material as proxy
  2. prestige
     - digital communication is viewed as more prestigious than traditional
  3. identity function
    - passive (read-only) vs active (two-way context)
  4. level of software support
    - input method
    - OS-level support
    - spellchecker
    - modern computational linguistics tools (parser, ASR, OCR, IE, MT)
  5. wikipedia
  6. among the first active digital language communities
  7. no wikipedia, no ascent
- 4-5: proxies for functional spread of a language
