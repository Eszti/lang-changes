# Review

## General questions

- How does the use of various communication languages in countries change over time? 
- Which languages grow and which disappear, and what are their characteristics? 
- Are there other factors that correlate with the appearance or disappearance of languages?

## Challenges of the task

### What does language extinction mean? [1]

- Narrow definition: A language with no native speakers.
- Dead language: no longer the native language of any community, even if still in use (e.g. Latin)

### What is a good measure for the use of communication languages?

- Verbal communication? - How to track and measure?
- Used passive (=read-only)? E.g. lexicons, classical literature, news services
- (Also) used active (=two-way context)? E.g. social networks, business/commerce, live literature 
- Importance of digital ascent and the phenomenon of digital language death [2]

At least language identification problem is considered as solved!

## Usual reasons for language death [1, 2]

- Traditional
  - As a result of cultural assimilation: Abandonment of a native language in favour of a lingua franca.
  - Population dies out
- Basic digital
  - No input method for characters.
  - No basic software support, e.g. OS-level support.
  - No spellchecker
- Advances digital
  - No NLP tools, like parser, speech recognition, OCR (optical character recognition) Google Translate

## Usual reasons for language revival [1, 2]

- Nation state creation (e.g. Hebrew)
- Digital ascent
- Presence of a university
- Strong economic incentives
